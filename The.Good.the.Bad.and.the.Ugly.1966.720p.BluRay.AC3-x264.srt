1
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,710
You're from Baker?

2
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,520
Tell Baker that I told him
all that I know already.

3
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,230
Tell him I want to live in peace
understand?

4
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,230
There is no use to go on tormenting me!

5
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,150
I know nothing at all
about that case of coins.

6
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,650
Now that gold has disappeared
but if he'd listened...

7
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,410
we could have avoided this altogether.

8
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,700
I went to the army court.
There were no witnesses.

9
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,450
They couldn't uncover any more.

10
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,460
I can't tell Baker
what happened to the money.

11
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,460
Go back and tell him that.

12
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,380
Word's around you had a visitor...

13
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,680
and Baker knows it.

14
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,470
Name of Jackson.

15
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,850
Well...

16
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,650
Jackson was here...

17
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,770
or Baker's got it all wrong.

18
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,200
He's not wrong.

19
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:52,540
Maybe Baker would like to know
just what you and Jackson had to say...

20
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,500
about the cash box.

21
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,300
That's not what I'm being paid for.

22
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,180
I'm only interested in what name
Jackson's hiding under now.

23
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,150
Why do you think Jackson may be
assuming another name?

24
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,560
I would have found him already.

25
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,780
When I start off to find somebody
I find him.

26
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,820
That's why they pay me.

27
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,540
What is Baker paying you?

28
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,290
That your family?

29
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,550
Yes.

30
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,720
Nice family.

31
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,890
What does he pay you for murdering me?

32
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,690
Five hundred dollars...

33
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,360
to get the name.

34
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,120
The name.

35
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,300
Carson. Bill Carson.

36
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,550
That's what he calls himself now.

37
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,710
That's a lot of money-- 1000.

38
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,590
A thousand dollars?

39
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,430
And some in gold. That's a tidy sum.

40
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,190
But when I'm paid
I always see the job through.

41
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,140
It's you.

42
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,850
Any information?

43
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,430
Too much.

44
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,690
He said quite a bit
that should interest you...

45
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,520
and one or two things that interested me.

46
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,020
Such as?

47
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,740
The name Jackson's hiding under
is Bill Carson.

48
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,160
That's your bit.

49
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,620
Keep talking.

50
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,000
He also mentioned something
about a certain cash box...

51
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,090
which just happened to disappear.

52
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,130
- That's my bit.
- Anything else?

53
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,220
Not enough for you eh?

54
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:20,100
Well you don't have to worry.
He won't say anything to anybody again.

55
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,560
Oh yeah yeah. Perfect.

56
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,810
Here you are.

57
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,650
Here. This is for you.
You did a good job for me.

58
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,650
Worth $500.

59
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,700
Yeah. I almost forgot.

60
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,280
He gave me a thousand.

61
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,410
I think his idea was that I kill you.

62
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:55,220
But you know the pity is when I'm paid
I always follow my job through.

63
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,300
- You know that.
- No! Angel Eyes--

64
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,060
No. No pistol amigo.
It won't do you any good.

65
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,020
There are three of us.

66
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:11,330
You know you've got a face
beautiful enough to be worth $2000?

67
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah.

68
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,760
But you don't look
like the one who'll collect it.

69
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,350
A couple steps back.

70
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,280
Thank you.

71
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,840
How much are you worth now?

72
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,340
How much?

73
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,220
Two thousand dollars.

74
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,260
- That's right-- $2000.
- Yeah.

75
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,740
You'll pay for this!
I hope you end up in a graveyard...

76
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,360
with the cholera
and the rabies and the plague!

77
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,830
Cut me loose!
Cut me loose you filthy bastard!

78
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,540
Put me down!

79
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,290
I hope your mother ends up in
a two-dollar whorehouse! Cut me loose!

80
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:20,130
You can still save yourself.
Let me go and I'll pardon you.

81
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,300
Let me go!

82
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,890
I think I feel sick.
The blood is bursting through my--

83
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,680
I'm dry Blondie.

84
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,060
Water.

85
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,690
You swine! You son of a bitch!

86
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,150
Let me go!

87
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,320
You're brave with a man
who's tied up! Come back!

88
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:51,620
Come back and fight! You bastard.

89
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,920
Who the hell is that?
One bastard goes in another comes out.

90
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,920
Cut it out! Cut it out!

91
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,340
I'm an honest farmer! I'm innocent of any--

92
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,470
So you're an honest farmer.
You recognize this man?

93
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,930
- Me?
- Yeah it's you.

94
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,270
Me? Who says so? You can't even read.

95
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,440
Yeah roll it up. Roll it up.

96
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,070
I'll give you a good idea
where you can put it.

97
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,780
To hell with all you sheriffs and
deputies and all who gave birth to you.

98
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,160
Hey everybody look!
He's giving him the filthy money!

99
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,410
Judas! You sold my hide!

100
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,700
But you won't enjoy
any of that money-- not a penny.

101
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,790
If there's justice in the world
every penny will go to the undertakers.

102
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,960
You know who you are?

103
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,300
You want to know whose son you are?

104
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,670
You don't I do. Everybody does.

105
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,510
You're the son of a thousand fathers
all bastards like you.

106
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,720
And your mother-- Your mother!

107
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,890
She's-- You bastard!

108
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,520
Your mother-- it's better not to talk of her!

109
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,140
I never hurt anybody!

- No. How much?
- $3000.

132
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,920
There are two kinds of people
in the world my friend--

133
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:54,930
those with a rope around their neck and
the people who have the job of cutting.

134
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,350
Listen the neck
at the end of the rope is mine.

135
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,060
I run the risks...

136
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,640
so the next time I want more than half.

137
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,190
You may run the risks my friend
but I do the cutting.

138
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,780
If we cut down my percentage--

139
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,820
Cigar?

140
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,950
It's liable to interfere with my aim.

you had better miss very well.

was the coins.

it ought to hold a hearing

00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,650
- He disappears and becomes Bill Carson.
- I know his name.

163
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,780
But you don't know
just who you're looking for and I do.

164
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,870
And when he's found
I'd be scared to be put in his shoes.

165
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,460
Where is Carson?

166
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,790
All I know is Carson reenlisted.
The poor guy's minus an eye.

167
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,170
He lives with a girl called Maria
who'll tell you.

168
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,550
She's a fresh young whore in the territory.

169
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,680
- Where's she?
- Now what's the name of that town?

170
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,510
Someplace fairly near.

171
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,470
Santa Ana.

172
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,100
Adios half-soldier.

173
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,320
Hey Luke hand me down a whiskey!

174
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,440
"...and the sheriff's office in Sonora.

175
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:20,570
"The condemned hired himself out
as a guide to a wagon train.

176
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,990
"After receiving his payment in advance
he deserted the wagon train...

177
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,660
"on the hunting grounds
of the Sioux Indians."

178
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,460
Glad they got him--
a man guilty of all those crimes.

179
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,380
People with ropes around their necks
don't always hang.

180
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,040
What do you mean?

181
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,260
"The condemned is also guilty--"

182
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,340
Even a filthy beggar like that
has got a protecting angel.

183
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,180
- "...as a Mexican general."
- A golden-haired angel watches over him.

184
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,100
"For all these crimes
the accused has made...

185
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,190
"a full spontaneous confession.

186
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,820
"Therefore we condemn him
to be hung by the neck until dead."

187
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,820
May the Lord have mercy
on his soul. Proceed.

188
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,380
Let's get the hell out of here!

189
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,670
What are you trying to say--
anybody can miss a shot?

190
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,670
Nobody misses
when I'm at the end of the rope.

191
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,210
You've never had a rope around
your neck. I'll tell you something.

192
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,760
When that rope starts to pull tight
you can feel the devil bite your ass.

193
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,600
Yeah you're right. It's getting tougher.

194
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:17,270
The way I figure there's not too much
future with a sawed-off runt like you.

195
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,570
What do you mean?

196
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:22,110
'Cause I don't think
you'll ever be worth more than $3000.

197
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,110
What do you mean?

198
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,120
I mean our partnership is untied.

199
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,790
Oh no. Not you. You remain tied.

200
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,580
I'll keep the money
and you can have the rope.

201
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,130
You filthy double-crossing bastard!

202
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:43,670
- Of all the stinking dirty tricks--
- The way back to town is only 70 miles.

203
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:49,220
You know if you save your breath
I feel a man like you could manage it.

204
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,600
You filthy bastard! Come here!

205
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,310
Come here! Cut this rope off!

206
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,560
Get off that horse you filthy coward!

207
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,440
If I ever catch you Blondie
I'll rip your heart out and eat it!

208
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,570
I'll scalp you! I'll skin you alive!
I'll hang you up by your thumbs!

209
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,410
You pig! You vulture!

210
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:10,120
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

211
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,500
Such ingratitude after all the times
I've saved your life.

212
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,800
Where are you going? Wait a minute.

213
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,420
This is only a trick.
You wouldn't leave me here.

214
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:28,430
Come back! Wait! Blondie!

215
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,180
Listen Blondie--

216
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,210
I believe madam is home.

217
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,750
Sweet dreams and many thanks
from the Seventh Cavalry!

218
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,390
You filthy rats!

219
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,660
Maria.

220
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,580
Honey? Is that you Bill?

221
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:55,260
Who are you? What do you want with me?

222
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,600
Go on talking about Bill Carson.

223
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,440
I don't know him.

224
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,110
You were calling to him in the dark.

225
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,740
Where is he?

226
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,030
What are you going to do to him?

227
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,490
I'll ask the questions.

228
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,160
Where is he?

229
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,760
Where is he? Where?

230
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,220
That's enough!

231
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:44,150
I don't know where he is.
He packed his things ten days ago...

232
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,020
and went away with his unit-- they all left.

233
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,990
Which company? Where'd they go?

234
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:58,740
Third Cavalry General Sibley.
They left for Santa Fe.

235
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:02,000
That's all I know I swear!

236
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,250
But but--

237
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,470
I'm very sorry but the store's closing.

238
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,510
- Revolvers.
- Yeah revolvers.

239
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,470
Revolvers.

240
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,350
Well here's where I keep the best ones.

241
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,150
Here. Remington Colt...

242
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,650
a Roat Smith-Wesson...

243
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,910
Colt-- Navy--

244
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,490
Joslyn...

245
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,120
another Remington.

246
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,250
- And this one is--
- That's enough.

247
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,580
Cartridges.

248
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,550
You want to try the pistol?
Just step out back.

249
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,930
Let's go.

250
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,390
Move. Move.

251
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,220
Cartridge.

252
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,070
- How much?
- Twenty dollars.

253
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,110
No.

254
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,120
Fifty dollars.

255
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,290
How much?

256
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,750
A hundred dollars.

257
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,920
Two hundred dollars.

258
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,670
It's all I've got.

259
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,710
Here.

260
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,860
Come here.

261
00:38:23,090 --> 00:39:11,890
If you work for a living
why do you kill yourself working?

262
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,790
Potatoes.

263
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:44,250
You've got to be poor to eat potatoes.

264
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,960
Really poor.

265
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,170
I'm rich. But I'm lonely.

266
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:56,260
The world is divided into two parts

267
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:01,640
those who have friends
and those who are lonely like poor Tuco.

268
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:08,820
You see I used to have a friend Pedro.

269
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,490
Chico and Ramon his two brothers
were my friends too.

270
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:19,370
But who knows where they are now?

271
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,790
It's too bad friends.
Tough luck I haven't found you.

272
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,000
I had a good deal for you.

273
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,050
There's a big son of a bitch
who's got $4000.

274
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,390
Four thousand dollars.

275
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,180
And now I know where to find it.

276
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:47,360
If they would help me catch him
I'd divide it four ways like a brother.

277
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,940
A thousand dollars each.

278
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,880
You're alive Tuco. Is it true?

279
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,970
And rich. Like you're going to be.

280
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:20,310
But people are saying
you got killed in Albuquerque.

281
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,720
And people talk bullshit.

282
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,400
I'm alive you bastards
and I always will be.

283
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,820
And I've come to give you $3000.

284
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,300
This morning I heard the whole thing.

285
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,510
They say that Colonel Canby's
closing in with his Northerners...

286
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,470
and no later than tomorrow
that they'll be in the city.

287
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,600
That's why these Southerners
are getting out.

288
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,100
You see as soon as these cowards hear
a Blue Shirt's around they run.

289
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,850
- These Rebels have no will to fight.
- Poor things.

290
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,520
They'll soon be finished.

291
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:14,190
We get rid of these bastards then we
begin making money on those Yankees.

292
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,320
They carry gold not paper dollars
and they're going to beat the South.

293
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,910
Look. See that one with the white beard
sitting in the wagon?

294
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:25,040
General Sibley. He looks dead.

295
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,460
He's finally getting out of our hair.
Hurray for Dixie!

296
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,920
Where's the owner of that horse?

297
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,050
- Please sir a bad heart condition--
- Where?

298
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,810
The war has frightened me already.

299
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:47,230
I'm looking for the owner of that horse.

300
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:52,230
He's tall blond he smokes a cigar
and he's a pig. Where is he now?

301
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,230
You leave him be.
He doesn't know who rides every horse.

302
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,440
You stay quiet old hen.

303
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,660
Upstairs. Upstairs in room four señor.

304
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:09,830
Hear that?

305
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,710
You rotten criminals. How dare you?

306
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,200
Your spurs.

307
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,350
There are two kinds of spurs my friend--

308
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:55,310
those that come in by the door...

309
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:58,020
and those that come in by the window.

310
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,270
Take off that pistol belt.

311
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,150
It's empty.

312
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,320
Mine isn't.

313
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,420
Even when Judas hanged himself
there was a storm too.

314
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,760
That could be cannon fire.

315
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,930
Cannon fire or storm
it's all the same to you.

316
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,270
You ever see this before my friend?

317
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,900
Throw it over the roof beam.

318
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,530
That's it.

319
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:06,960
Now get on that.

320
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,810
That's right.

321
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:21,430
Now make sure the rope is tight.

322
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,100
It's got to hold the weight of a pig.

323
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,360
Now put the rope around your neck.

324
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:42,200
That's very good.

325
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,330
It's too big for your neck huh?

326
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,590
We fix that right away.
I have another system...

327
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:51,340
a little different than yours.

328
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,090
I don't shoot the rope.
I shoot the legs off the stool.

329
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:14,250
Welcome my friend.

330
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:18,000
If you're looking for a summer
vacation spot you've found it.

331
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:21,550
Our hotel is luxurious
and filled with conveniences.

332
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,720
And the attractions don't stop there.

333
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,970
International cuisine
healthful and nutritious food.

334
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,020
Corn cobs Dixie-style.

335
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,940
Our government has spared no expense.

336
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,690
As you can see we are treated very well.

337
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:41,190
Have you ever heard of anyone
by the name of Bill Carson?

338
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,660
And you? Have you ever heard
of someone named Canby? No?

339
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:50,910
Well you see he's a Yankee colonel
who decided to tear us to pieces.

340
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
The only thing we care about
is saving our own hides.

341
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,420
And you ask me if I know someone.

342
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,500
I just don't know what you drifters
could be thinking.

343
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:15,730
Carson has a patch over one eye.
He's with the Third.

344
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:21,900
If he's with the Third they've already left.

345
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,990
For Glorieta.

346
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:28,200
Canby's front line is right on their heels.
Those poor young devils.

347
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:33,120
And the desert lies ahead of them. I really
doubt that any of them are still alive.

348
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:36,870
And what if they were still alive?

349
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,630
Worse.

350
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:45,170
Well then you must not have
heard anything about Batterville.

351
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:49,930
It's one of those Yankee prison camps
you'd better hope you never end up in.

352
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,970
Keep it. It's yours.

353
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:22,540
"We have found the accused
Thomas Larson alias Shorty Larson...

354
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:25,250

364
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,450
-No.
-No?

365
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:56,240
"...we have condemned

"to hang by the neck until dead."

00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:03,290
May God have mercy on his soul. Proceed.

369
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,510
Sorry Shorty.

370
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,760
Move. Come on let's go.

371
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,450
I don't know. As soon as I hit
the desert I'm thirsty.

372
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:48,580
Burns huh? They say people
with fair skin can't take too much.

373
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,400
Like that
you won't have to carry so much.

374
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,780
Where we going?

375
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:23,040
Where? Where I'm going amigo.

376
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:25,700
Over that way.

377
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:30,170
Another hundred miles
of beautiful sunbaked sand.

378
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,630
Even the armies are afraid
to march through there.

379
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,010
Sibley's men are retreating up there.

380
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:37,010
Canby's men are coming here.

381
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,300
But no one will set foot in this hell...

382
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:44,560
except you and me.

383
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:49,190
One hundred miles-- that's a nice walk.

384
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,900
What was it you told me the last time?

385
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:00,910
"If you save your breath
I feel a man like you could manage it."

386
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:07,450
And if you won't manage it
you'll die only slowly--

387
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:11,120
very slowly old friend.

388
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,970
After you please. Start walking.

389
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,380
Taking a rest?

390
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:21,000
Come on Blondie.
We don't have very far to go.

391
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:22,920
Only 70 miles.

392
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:27,260
Only eight and a half hours more
before sunset.

393
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:29,930
That's not too bad.

394
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,100
Come on.

395
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:25,380
Okay let's eat.

396
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:27,960
That is I'll eat.

397
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,300
Meanwhile you can enjoy a sunbath.

398
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:45,730
You want some water?

399
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,780
Drink. Drink.

400
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:59,580
Come on. Come on.

401
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,790
Well Blondie. So long.

402
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:53,230
And so Blondie...

403
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,610
it's good-bye.

404
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:55,840
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

405
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,300
Whoa boy.

406
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,760
Easy easy.

407
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:05,770
Easy easy. Attaboy. That's nice.

408
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:37,790
Water. Water.

409
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,800
200000 in gold.
It's yours. Just get me water.

410
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:54,890
What's that you say?

411
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,190
Who the hell are you?

412
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:58,560
Carson.

413
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:01,940
My name is Bill Carson now. It's Carson.

414
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:04,070
Surprise attack.

415
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:09,700
All dead. My name is Jackson not Carson.

416
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:12,080
Carson yeah yeah.
Glad to meet you Carson.

417
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:15,910
I'm Lincoln's grandfather.
What did you say about the dollars?

418
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,790
200000-- all mine.

419
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:21,130
Was the Third Cavalry's.

420
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:24,460
Baker has nothing.

421
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:29,050
The gold-- I hid the gold. The gold is safe.

422
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:32,100
Where? Where here?

423
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:33,680
Here? Talk!

424
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:36,350
- Huh?
- In the cemetery.

425
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,940
- Which cemetery?
- The one...

426
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:42,230
on Sad Hill.

427
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:45,190
There's a grave by--

428
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:47,240
Which grave?

429
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,740
Have a name? Have a number?

430
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:52,280
Come on you dummy talk.

431
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:57,750
There's no number. There's a name.

432
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:00,380
- Huh?
- It's written--

433
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,250
Yes?

434
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:09,550
Water!

435
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:14,930
You talk first huh?
I'll give you water later.

436
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:18,020
Sad Hill Cemetery. Okay.
In the grave. Okay.

437
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,560
But it must have a name
or a number on it huh?

438
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:23,360
There must be a thousand five thousand!

439
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:32,070
Don't die huh?
Don't die. I'll get you water.

440
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,490
Stay there. Don't move. I'll get you water.

441
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:38,200
Don't die until later you son of a--

442
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:05,400
Get away from there!

443
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,570
- He's dead.
- Yeah.

444
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:18,240
I'll kill you.

445
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:24,170
If you do that you'll always be poor...

446
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:28,800
just like the greasy rat that you are.

447
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:33,180
If I were you I'd keep me alive.

448
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:36,510
What did he tell you huh?

449
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,020
- A name.
- Huh?

450
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:42,060
- A name on a grave.
- What name?

451
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:58,700
Blondie don't die.

452
01:12:58,790 --> 01:13:02,210
Blondie don't die. I'm your friend.

453
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:05,960
Please don't die. Please!
I'm your friend. Come on.

454
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:13,220
I'll help you. I'll help you.
Don't move. I'll be right back.

455
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:16,550
Here's the water. Don't die like that pig.

456
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:20,560
Hey Blondie here's water. Water Blondie.

457
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,560
Don't drink don't drink. Is no good for you.

458
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,390
Feel better?

459
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,940
Blondie what's the matter?
Please don't die.

460
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:40,370
Hey open up! Open up! Hurry!

461
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:43,200
Settle down. Settle down. Who's there?

462
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,500
What do you mean "Who's there?"
You think I'm the enemy?

463
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:55,300
If I were a Yankee
you wouldn't have time to ask me that.

464
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:56,720
Come on.

465
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,510
Sergeant listen to
this corporal for a moment.

466
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,600
Yes sir.

467
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:05,140
Sergeant I have a gravely wounded man
here if he's not dead already.

468
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:10,900
- He's still alive?
- Well he seems to be.

469
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,940
- What happened?
- It was a trap.

470
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:18,070
- Only the two of us got away.
- Name and traveling papers.

471
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:24,040
Here. Corporal Bill Carson.
Third Regiment 2nd Cavalry Squadron

472
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,790
arriving from San Rafael. Is that enough?

473
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:35,210
Are you reading when this man is dying?

474
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:39,140
Why Corporal we're trying to withdraw
and you're looking for an infirmary?

475
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:42,890
If you want one you'll have
to make yourself a Yankee prisoner.

476
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:47,020
- So where are we?
- Near Apache Canyon.

477
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,980
- Apache Canyon?
- Apache Canyon.

478
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:53,480
Is a Mission San Antonio around here?

479
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:55,940
Sure 18 miles south. Take him there.

480
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:59,820
The brothers take care of any wounded
no matter what the color of his uniform.

481
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:02,580
And keep your eyes open
the area is full of Yankees.

482
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:04,410
Thank you. Goodbye Sergeant.

483
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,750
Take care.

484
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,440
- I've got a very sick man here.
- But we have no more beds here.

485
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,440
Let him have yours.

486
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:43,320
- Where's Pablo Ramirez?
- Father Ramirez.

487
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:45,280
He's away at the moment.

488
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:47,750
He should be back any day now.

489
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:52,210
Well it doesn't matter. For the moment
we take very good care of my friend.

490
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:54,040
And may God be praised.

491
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:56,500
In case you didn't know it
God is on our side too...

492
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:59,720
because He hates the Yanks huh Blondie?

493
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,260
Blondie? Father is he still breathing?

494
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:06,220
- Yes of course.
- You're heavy.

495
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,110
There.

496
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:51,390
All right put a fresh bandage on him.

497
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:54,520
Put him in my cell.

498
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:56,940
Easy.

499
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:03,110
- Out soldier. Out you go. Come on.
- Look out for him please.

500
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,200
He's like a brother to me.

501
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:12,870
Hey Father I--

502
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,260
Father did he speak? Did he say anything?

503
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:01,170
Father did he ask for me?
Did he speak about anything Father?

504
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:04,340
Oh no he hasn't spoken as yet.
But you mustn't worry.

505
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:08,430
He's both young and strong.
That's what's kept him going until now.

506
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:10,970
He should regain his strength
in a very short time.

507
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,600
Thank you Father. You don't know
how much this boy's life means to me.

508
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:15,770
Thanks be to Jesus. Thanks to all of you.

509
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:13,990
Hey Blondie.

510
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:37,930
The old father tells me you'll be
up and around in a few days.

511
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:41,770
You're very lucky
to have me so close when it happened.

512
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,400
Think if you'd been on your own.

513
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:48,150
Look I mean when--

514
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:50,950
when one is ill...

515
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:53,620
it's good to have somebody close by--

516
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:55,660
friends or relations.

517
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:01,670
Do you have parents Blondie? A mother?

518
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:04,210
Not even a mother.

519
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:06,750
No one?

520
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:10,420
You're all alone huh? Like me Blondie.

521
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:13,470
We're all alone in the world.

522
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:16,760
I have you you have me.

523
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:20,680
Only for a little while I mean.

524
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,440
It had to happen now.

525
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:26,650
What a dirty rotten trick of fate.

526
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:29,740
We could have all that money
in our hands.

527
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:38,700
I must tell you the truth.

528
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:41,620
In my place you would do the same thing.

529
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:45,750
It's all over for you now.

530
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:49,260
There's nothing anyone can do anymore.

531
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:56,220
God help me. It's my fault.
Mine mine mine.

532
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:10,280
I'll tell you one thing Blondie.

533
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:13,860
If I knew that my last hour had come
I swear...

534
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:17,240
in my place-- in your place
I would do the same thing.

535
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:21,540
I would tell about the gold. Yes I would.

536
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:24,040
I'd tell the name on the grave.

537
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,790
After all what good is
the money to you if you're dead?

538
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:31,130
I know the name of the cemetery
but you know how many graves are there?

539
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:35,510
Please Blondie.

540
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:41,720
Please have a little huh? Here. Coffee.

541
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:43,640
Please tell me the name...

542
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,980
on the grave.

543
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:51,400
If I get my hands on the $200000...

544
01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:55,110
I'll always honor your memory.

545
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:59,280
I swear I'll always honor your memory.

546
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:04,330
Come closer.

547
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:10,920
Tell me.

548
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,920
Why you dirty--

549
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:18,760
I'll sleep better...

550
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:24,520
knowing my good friend is by my side...

551
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,440
to protect me.

552
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:37,360
"Tuco water." Here's water.

553
01:22:37,450 --> 01:22:40,700
But if I get that name from you
I'll give you water.

554
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:51,000
All right you dirty skunk
get your ass off the bed.

555
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:53,170
Come on the party's over.

556
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:55,210
The wagon is all ready to go.

557
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:58,300
From the way the wounded are pouring
into this place we better leave...

558
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,510
before we get caught up in the war.

559
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,720
- Tuco Father Ramirez is back.
- Yeah.

560
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:08,350
This is something I have to look into.
It'll only take a minute. Get moving.

561
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,400
- Where this way?
- Yes.

562
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:39,260
Don't you recognize me?

563
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:44,930
It's me Tuco. Let me embrace you.

564
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,020
I don't know the right thing.

565
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:58,190
I was just passing by here
I said to myself...

566
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,610
"I wonder if my brother
remembers his brother."

567
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:06,200
Did I do wrong?

568
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:10,160
It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.

569
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:12,210
You have seen me Tuco.

570
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:17,130
Yeah well I'm very glad I came.

571
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:25,180
Oh my uniform!

572
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:27,180
It's a long story.

573
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:32,390
But let's talk about you.
It's more important. You look very well.

574
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:35,060
A bit thin perhaps but...

575
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,860
you were always thin eh Pablito?

576
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:44,660
What about our parents?

577
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:51,250
Only now do you think of them.
To begin after nine years.

578
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,830
Nine years?

579
01:24:57,170 --> 01:25:00,880
So it's nine years. Nine years!

580
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:04,760
Our mother has been dead
a long time now.

581
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:08,760
Our father died only a few days ago.

582
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:11,560
That's why I was away.

583
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:17,150
He asked for you to be there
but there was only me.

584
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:27,200
And you?

585
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,200
Outside of evil
what else have you managed to do?

586
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:34,370
It seems to me
you once had a wife someplace.

587
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:39,750
Not one. Lots of them.

588
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,420
One here one there
wherever I found them.

589
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:46,180
Go on preach me a sermon Pablo.

590
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:50,220
What good would that be?

591
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:55,060
Just keep on the way you're going.
Go away.

592
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:59,440
- And the Lord have mercy on your soul.
- Sure I'll go I'll go.

593
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,320
While I'm waiting for the Lord
to remember me...

594
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,610
I Tuco Ramirez
brother of Brother Ramirez...

595
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:07,990
will tell you something.

596
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:10,160
You think you're better than I am.

597
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:12,870
Where we came from
if one didn't want to die of poverty...

598
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:15,370
one became a priest or a bandit.

599
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:18,000
You chose your way I chose mine.

600
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,840
Mine was harder!

601
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,550
You talk about Mother and Father.

602
01:26:21,630 --> 01:26:25,220
You remember when you left
to become a priest I stayed behind.

603
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:29,180
I must have been ten twelve.
I don't remember which but I stayed.

604
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:33,810
I tried but it was no good.
Now I will tell you something.

605
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:38,940
You became a priest because you were
too much of a coward to do what I do.

606
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:57,960
Tuco.

607
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,090
Please forgive me brother.

608
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:42,330
Ah my belly's full.

609
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,760
Nice guy my brother.

610
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:49,220
I didn't tell you
my brother was in charge here?

611
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:51,430
Everything. Like the pope almost.

612
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:55,060
He's in charge in Rome.
Yeah yeah my brother he say to me...

613
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:58,850
"Stay brother. Don't go home.
We never see each other.

614
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:03,440
"Here there's plenty to eat and drink.
Bring your friend too."

615
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:08,440
Whenever we see each other he never
lets me go. It's always the same story.

616
01:28:08,530 --> 01:28:11,280
My brother-- he is crazy about me.

617
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:19,080
That's so. Even a tramp like me
no matter what happens...

618
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:24,840
I know there's a brother somewhere
who will never refuse me a bowl of soup.

619
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:27,880
Sure.

620
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:33,220
Well after a meal
there's nothing like a good cigar.

621
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:26,400
Here's the Sierra Magdalena.

622
01:29:27,190 --> 01:29:29,730
Going this way we cross the Rio Grande.

623
01:29:30,610 --> 01:29:32,530
That sure is a long way.

624
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:37,240
Here to the northwest
through all of Texas...

625
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,040
- After that...
- Then what?

626
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:45,420
When we get there I'll tell you.
You're not worried are you?

627
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:52,300
Those men aren't worried
about anything anymore are they?

628
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,090
But since I'm alive and I've noticed

629
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:00,720
we'll be crossing Yankee and
Confederate lines a few times.

630
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,980
I thought you might tell me
where we're going.

631
01:30:04,810 --> 01:30:08,360
Towards $200000.
Is that good enough for you?

632
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:24,000
Whoa.

633
01:30:27,830 --> 01:30:30,210
Hey wake up you.

634
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:33,210
- The troops are coming. Come on.
- Blue or gray?

635
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:43,970
They're gray like us. Let's say
"hello" to them and then get going.

636
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:47,940
Hoorah! Hoorah for the Confederacy!

637
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:51,310
Hoorah! Down with General Grant!

638
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:54,480
- Hoorah for General-- what's his name?
- Lee.

639
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:56,280
Lee!

640
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,490
God is with us
because He hates the Yanks too!

641
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:06,000
God's not on our side
'cause He hates idiots also.

642
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:20,720
Hut two three four.

643
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:28,810
Prisoners of war forward!

644
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,060
March!

645
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:25,580
Halt!

646
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:31,120
Left face!

647
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:37,420
Form a single file. Move!

648
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:22,510
- Jonathan Frost!
- Present!

649
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:32,100
- Richard McGilley!
- Present!

650
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:35,100
- Nathaniel Sullivan!
- Present.

651
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,400
- Robert Clark!
- Present.

652
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:42,360
- Sam Richmond!
- Present.

653
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,780
Bill Carson.

654
01:33:53,790 --> 01:33:56,000
I said Bill Carson!

655
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:59,250
Hey Blondie isn't that Angel Eyes?

656
01:34:00,050 --> 01:34:02,630
All right what's he doing sleeping?

657
01:34:06,090 --> 01:34:09,260
Yeah and you better be Bill Carson.

658
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:11,140
Bill Carson!

659
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:13,480
Yeah that's me.

660
01:34:22,110 --> 01:34:24,150
Please Carson...

661
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,200
answer "present."

662
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:30,780
What are you deaf?

663
01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:39,580
Now suppose you say "present" Carson.

664
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,170
I like big fat men like you.

665
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:46,130
When they fall they make more noise...

666
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:48,680
and sometimes they never get up.

667
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:51,430
Wallace...

668
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:54,770
that's enough.

669
01:34:57,730 --> 01:34:58,850
Sergeant!

670
01:35:01,110 --> 01:35:03,570
The captain wants to see you right away.

671
01:35:07,110 --> 01:35:09,860
Be sure these two get good treatment.

672
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:23,250
Hey Blondie did you hear that?
Good treatment.

673
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,420
Yeah.

674
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:32,600
For the last time Sergeant...

675
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:37,270
I'm telling you I want the prisoners
treated as prisoners.

676
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:39,890
No more brutality.

677
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:44,570
There's hundreds of prisoners out there
and only a few men to guard them.

678
01:35:44,650 --> 01:35:47,070
Now what am I supposed to do?
I have to have respect.

679
01:35:47,150 --> 01:35:51,820
I think that you'll manage to gain
their respect by treating them better.

680
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:55,950
Are our men treated that well
in Andersonville camp?

681
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:58,870
I don't give a goddamn
what they do in Andersonville.

682
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:02,250
While I'm in charge here
the prisoners are not to be tortured...

683
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:05,380
or cheated or murdered.

684
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:08,170
That an accusation?

685
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:13,550
Sergeant gangrene is eating
my leg away not my eyes.

686
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:17,270
I know the prisoners here
are being robbed systematically.

687
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:20,640
I know there's scum around
who are bivouacked near the camp...

688
01:36:20,730 --> 01:36:23,940
waiting for someone to deliver this loot.

689
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:29,030
But as long as I'm commandant I won't
permit any such trickery. Am I clear?

690
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:32,820
Yes sir...

691
01:36:32,910 --> 01:36:35,200
just as long as you're the commandant.

692
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:38,450
Yes Sergeant.

693
01:36:41,330 --> 01:36:44,670
I know this leg means
I won't last very long...

694
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:49,300
but I pray I can manage to have
enough time to amass evidence...

695
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:51,630
and bring to a court-martial...

696
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:54,300
all those who discredit and dishonor...

697
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:57,060
the uniform of the Union.

698
01:37:02,230 --> 01:37:04,190
I wish you luck.

699
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:41,930
You and the others better lay low
for a few days.

700
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:46,350
No I'll keep this. You go.
Wallace will let you know.

701
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:00,950
- Bring me Carson.
- Right.

702
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:19,010
Listen Angel Eyes said
for us to lay low for a few days...

703
01:38:19,100 --> 01:38:22,520
but we'll keep close enough
to keep an eye on things.

704
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:24,140
Come on saddle your horses.

705
01:38:24,850 --> 01:38:26,310
Get in.

706
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:38,360
Come on in Tuco. Don't be bashful.

707
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:41,740
There's no formalities here.

708
01:38:53,170 --> 01:38:55,300
It's been a long time.

709
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:02,180
You're hungry. Sit down eat.

710
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:24,290
I knew it I knew it.

711
01:39:25,870 --> 01:39:29,120
The minute I saw you I said to myself...

712
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:31,630
"Look at that pig Angel Eyes.

713
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:35,380
"I'll bet he got himself an easy job...

714
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:40,720
"and he never forgets a friend."

715
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,930
I never forget old friends Tuco.

716
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:49,600
- Right.
- It's good to see old friends again.

717
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:52,860
Good.

718
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:56,400
Especially when they've come
from so far away...

719
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:58,820
and have so much to talk about.

720
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:03,120
And you do have a lot
to talk about haven't you?

721
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:08,750
You were captured near Fort Craig.

722
01:40:13,630 --> 01:40:17,090
Well if you were with Sibley
that means then that you...

723
01:40:17,170 --> 01:40:19,340
were coming from Santa Fe.

724
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:35,270
- Was it hard crossing the desert?
- Very hard.

725
01:40:37,190 --> 01:40:40,240
Especially if you don't have
anything to drink.

726
01:40:42,410 --> 01:40:45,740
Why are you going under the name
of Bill Carson now?

727
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:53,830
One name is as good as another.

728
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:56,130
Not wise to use your own name.

729
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:00,420
Like you. I'll bet
they don't call you Angel Eyes.

730
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:03,220
Sergeant Angel Eyes.

731
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:15,400
Like a little music with your meal Tuco?

732
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:19,650
Music? Yes it's very good--
very good for the digestion.

733
01:41:33,290 --> 01:41:34,460
So...

734
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:38,040
Bill Carson's a fake name huh?

735
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:44,970
That fake too?

736
01:41:47,050 --> 01:41:49,390
Bill Carson's name's written in it.

737
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:54,980
Have some. It's Bill Carson's tobacco.

738
01:43:19,190 --> 01:43:21,770
Was Carson dead or alive
when you found him?

739
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:31,030
What'd he tell you about the money?

740
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:33,240
I don't--

741
01:43:33,330 --> 01:43:36,790
I don't know what you're talking about.

742
01:43:54,810 --> 01:43:56,350
More feeling.

743
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:18,580
You can sure consider yourself
much luckier than your pal.

744
01:44:18,660 --> 01:44:21,580
Wallace will punch your friend
as long as the song goes.

745
01:44:21,670 --> 01:44:24,670
So many of us have had a session in there.

746
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:47,860
How's your digestion now?

747
01:44:52,030 --> 01:44:53,780
You'd better talk.

748
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:56,120
I have nothing to tell you.

749
01:45:23,730 --> 01:45:25,520
Play that fiddle you!

750
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:12,610
Enough. Enough. I talk. I talk.

751
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,120
What did he say about the money?

752
01:46:28,130 --> 01:46:30,590
It's buried in a grave.

753
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:34,880
- Where?
- Sad Hill--

754
01:46:34,970 --> 01:46:37,430
Sad Hill Cemetery.

755
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:41,680
Which grave?

756
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:46,350
I don't know. I don't know I tell you.

757
01:46:49,730 --> 01:46:51,980
Ask Blondie.

758
01:46:52,070 --> 01:46:54,940
He knows the name on the grave.

759
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:18,680
Put those clothes on.

760
01:47:22,850 --> 01:47:26,270
- Why?
- We're going for a ride.

761
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:31,020
- Where?
- To find $200000.

762
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:34,980
I know the name of the cemetery now...

763
01:47:35,070 --> 01:47:37,650
and you know the name of the grave.

764
01:47:57,550 --> 01:48:00,550
You're not gonna give me
the same treatment?

765
01:48:04,390 --> 01:48:05,970
Would you talk?

766
01:48:07,060 --> 01:48:08,810
No probably not.

767
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:12,150
That's what I thought.

768
01:48:13,190 --> 01:48:15,320
Not that you're any tougher than Tuco...

769
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:18,990
but you're smart enough to know
that talking won't save you.

770
01:48:22,490 --> 01:48:25,530
And Tuco-- is he--

771
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:31,040
Not yet.

772
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:33,380
But he's in very good hands.

773
01:48:34,710 --> 01:48:37,840
You've changed partners
but you still got the same deal.

774
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:40,550
I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.

775
01:48:41,890 --> 01:48:45,350
There's two of us. It should
make it easier than just one.

776
01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:51,940
Yeah.

777
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,580
Hold it. That's it don't move.

778
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:20,090
Now don't breathe. Still. That's it.

779
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:23,970
Got it. Thank you.

780
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:43,700
Hey Corporal afraid he'll get lost?
Where's the rebel going?

781
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:47,370
To hell with a rope around his neck
and a price on his head.

782
01:49:47,450 --> 01:49:49,290
$3000 friend.

783
01:49:49,370 --> 01:49:51,620
That's a lot of money for a head.

784
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:56,000
I'll bet they didn't even pay you
a penny for your arm.

785
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:05,380
I told you once friend
if I ever get you down...

786
01:50:05,470 --> 01:50:08,680
you're gonna need a lot of help
to get up again.

787
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:30,490
You're a lot luckier than that one.

788
01:50:30,580 --> 01:50:33,120
Grub a rope and you're all finished.

789
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:35,910
And there isn't any partner this time to
shoot you down.

790
01:52:18,310 --> 01:52:23,400
If your friends stay out in the damp
they're liable to catch a cold aren't they?

791
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:24,980
Or a bullet.

792
01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:31,990
Hear that boys? Come on out here.

793
01:52:44,670 --> 01:52:48,050
Since we're all going in the same
direction might as well go together.

794
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:54,050
One two three four

795
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:56,760
five six.

796
01:52:57,470 --> 01:53:00,350
Six... Perfect number.

797
01:53:01,940 --> 01:53:04,150
Isn't three the perfect number?

798
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:09,030
Yeah. But I got six more bullets in my gun.

799
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:15,720
Sure would like to put
your paw on it huh?

800
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:19,760
I would like to piss. It's rough.

801
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:22,350
I've been shaken up on this train
nearly ten hours now.

802
01:54:22,430 --> 01:54:25,270
You smell like a pig already...

803
01:54:25,350 --> 01:54:27,860
but let's not try to make things any worse.

804
01:54:30,190 --> 01:54:31,780
Get going.

805
01:54:40,870 --> 01:54:43,200
I can't while you're watching me.

806
01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:09,560
You made a lot of noise my friend huh?

807
01:55:30,630 --> 01:55:34,050
You don't want to break our friendship
huh? Well I'll break it.

808
01:57:18,860 --> 01:57:20,440
Halt.

809
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:23,490
Take your places.

810
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:36,290
Ready!

811
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:38,960
Aim! Fire!

812
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:58,520
Slim take care of the horses.

813
02:02:15,070 --> 02:02:18,660
I've been looking for you for eight months.

814
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:23,330
Whenever I should've had a gun
in my right hand I thought of you.

815
02:02:23,410 --> 02:02:27,330
Now I find you in exactly
the position that suits me.

816
02:02:27,420 --> 02:02:31,090
I had lots of time to learn
how to shoot with my left.

817
02:02:47,150 --> 02:02:50,110
When you have to shoot shoot. Don't talk.

818
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:55,950
Every gun makes its own tune.

819
02:02:56,950 --> 02:02:58,950
It's perfect timing Large One.

820
02:03:17,260 --> 02:03:19,470
Clem follow him.

821
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:19,400
Just a minute. I'll be right there.

822
02:04:19,490 --> 02:04:23,200
Just give me a little time
to get dressed and I'll open up.

823
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:46,390
Put your drawers on and take your gun off.

824
02:04:59,530 --> 02:05:02,240
How the hell did you get out
of that pigsty?

825
02:05:03,660 --> 02:05:07,450
My own way. I'm here
with your old friend Angel Eyes.

826
02:05:08,540 --> 02:05:11,580
You talked you traitor. You talked.

827
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:13,960
No I didn't talk.

828
02:05:14,630 --> 02:05:17,090
If I did I probably wouldn't be here now.

829
02:05:18,460 --> 02:05:20,590
You me--

830
02:05:21,550 --> 02:05:24,050
So only you know your half of the secret?

831
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:33,520
I'm very happy you're working with me...

832
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:35,520
and we're together again.

833
02:05:35,610 --> 02:05:37,860
I get dressed I kill him and be right back.

834
02:05:37,940 --> 02:05:39,610
Oh listen...

835
02:05:39,690 --> 02:05:41,570
I forgot to mention--

836
02:05:43,450 --> 02:05:46,070
He's not alone. There's five of them.

837
02:05:48,490 --> 02:05:51,120
- Five?
- Yeah five of them.

838
02:05:54,210 --> 02:05:56,630
So that's why you came to Tuco?

839
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:02,220
It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all.

840
02:06:14,270 --> 02:06:16,400
They shot him at close range.

841
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:38,080
Well look who's here.

842
02:06:38,170 --> 02:06:40,340
The other one will be along.

843
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:45,090
They'll come looking for us.

844
02:06:46,510 --> 02:06:47,930
Watch out.

845
02:06:49,010 --> 02:06:50,640
There's two of them.

846
02:06:52,020 --> 02:06:54,140
I want that blond alive.

847
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:06,360
You back there. Come on let's go.

848
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:42,650
Were you gonna die alone?

849
02:09:33,550 --> 02:09:34,680
Halt!

850
02:10:00,950 --> 02:10:04,120
- Angel Eyes is mine huh?
- All right.

851
02:10:43,710 --> 02:10:45,790
"See you soon--"

852
02:10:48,460 --> 02:10:49,920
"Idiots."

853
02:10:51,090 --> 02:10:52,590
It's for you.

854
02:11:17,530 --> 02:11:20,530
How peaceful and quiet amigo.

855
02:11:20,620 --> 02:11:22,910
Like a cemetery for instance?

856
02:11:24,410 --> 02:11:27,370
There should be a bridge across that river.

857
02:11:27,460 --> 02:11:30,710
- We'd better wait for nightfall.
- Trust in me Blondie.

858
02:11:34,130 --> 02:11:35,880
I got a good sense of where I'm going.

859
02:11:35,970 --> 02:11:39,840
Tuco has taken you this far.
I will take you all the way--

860
02:11:39,930 --> 02:11:41,470
Gentlemen.

861
02:11:44,980 --> 02:11:46,810
- Tell the captain.
- Yes sir.

862
02:11:48,150 --> 02:11:50,060
Come along now. Follow me.

863
02:12:37,280 --> 02:12:39,700
We found them near the perimeter sir.

864
02:12:54,340 --> 02:12:57,920
- Where do you hail from?
- Illinois.

865
02:13:00,510 --> 02:13:04,050
- And you?
- I'm with him.

866
02:13:10,390 --> 02:13:12,770
Any reason for being around here?

867
02:13:13,690 --> 02:13:16,070
We want to enlist General.

868
02:13:19,070 --> 02:13:21,570
You better learn to distinguish rank.

869
02:13:21,660 --> 02:13:23,360
I'm a captain.

870
02:13:25,030 --> 02:13:26,660
Get the hell out.

871
02:13:28,250 --> 02:13:31,330
It sure as hell might be you today
so go write your will.

872
02:13:31,420 --> 02:13:32,750
Yes sir.

873
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:39,880
So you want to enlist?

874
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:43,550
You gotta take a test to prove it.

875
02:13:52,690 --> 02:13:54,270
Well show me.

876
02:14:18,130 --> 02:14:22,420
You've got a career. At the least
I'd say you'll make colonel.

877
02:14:22,510 --> 02:14:24,180
- Really?
- Sure.

878
02:14:25,300 --> 02:14:27,470
Like it says in the manual...

879
02:14:27,550 --> 02:14:29,100
"You've got every qualification...

880
02:14:29,180 --> 02:14:31,810
"to become an expert
in the use of weapons."

881
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:37,270
For this sir
is the most potent weapon in war.

882
02:14:40,110 --> 02:14:42,530
The fighting spirit's in this bottle.

883
02:14:44,610 --> 02:14:46,110
Volunteers.

884
02:14:48,330 --> 02:14:50,120
You want to enlist hmm?

885
02:14:51,660 --> 02:14:53,080
Let's go.

886
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:55,120
Come on gentlemen. Come on.

887
02:14:57,750 --> 02:15:00,750
The shooting hasn't begun yet.
You're still in time.

888
02:15:16,690 --> 02:15:18,980
Whoever has the most liquor
to get the soldiers drunk

889
02:15:19,060 --> 02:15:22,570
and send them to be slaughtered...
is the winner.

890
02:15:23,530 --> 02:15:28,320
We and the ones over on the other side of
the river only have one thing in common.

891
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:32,330
All of us reek of alcohol.

892
02:15:40,380 --> 02:15:42,500
What did you say your name was?

893
02:15:45,220 --> 02:15:46,510
And you?

894
02:15:49,850 --> 02:15:50,850
No.

895
02:15:56,560 --> 02:15:58,230
Names don't matter.

896
02:15:59,060 --> 02:16:03,440
Yes because soon you can join
the gallant heroes of Branson Bridge.

897
02:16:05,030 --> 02:16:08,700
- We have two attacks a day.
- Two attacks a day?

898
02:16:08,780 --> 02:16:12,320
Sure the Rebs have decided
that damn bridge...

899
02:16:12,410 --> 02:16:15,160
is the key to this whole area.

900
02:16:15,250 --> 02:16:18,370
Stupid useless bridge.

901
02:16:18,460 --> 02:16:21,080
Flyspeck on headquarters' maps.

902
02:16:22,790 --> 02:16:27,590
And headquarters has declared
we must take that ridiculous flyspeck...

903
02:16:29,300 --> 02:16:31,390
even if all of us are killed.

904
02:16:31,470 --> 02:16:33,680
Otherwise the key will get rusty...

905
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:35,760
and just be a spot on the wall.

906
02:16:37,270 --> 02:16:38,930
And that's not all.

907
02:16:39,270 --> 02:16:41,850
Both sides want the bridge intact.

908
02:16:41,940 --> 02:16:44,230
Intact is how the South wants it...

909
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:46,360
and we want it intact too.

910
02:16:49,110 --> 02:16:51,160
You'll all turn to dust...

911
02:16:51,240 --> 02:16:53,530
but one thing is sure boys:

912
02:16:53,620 --> 02:16:56,330
Branson Bridge will stand unbroken.

913
02:16:57,870 --> 02:17:01,960
Is it bad to speak the way I do
to volunteers?

914
02:17:03,210 --> 02:17:05,130
I've done a lot worse.

915
02:17:09,720 --> 02:17:12,970
I've done it. I've blown it up. Boom!

916
02:17:14,300 --> 02:17:17,260
In here I've destroyed it all.

917
02:17:18,480 --> 02:17:20,390
It's a court-martial offense to imagine...

918
02:17:20,480 --> 02:17:23,480
to dream of blowing it up--
a serious crime.

919
02:17:23,980 --> 02:17:28,070
Even to think of destroying
that bridge is just--

920
02:17:30,990 --> 02:17:33,320
Why not really blow it up Captain?

921
02:17:34,820 --> 02:17:37,580
Yeah Captain it's nothing.
Let's scare the hell out of them.

922
02:17:41,670 --> 02:17:43,750
I've been dreaming about it.

923
02:17:47,460 --> 02:17:49,380
I've even worked out a plan.

924
02:17:51,130 --> 02:17:52,510
I sure have.

925
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:56,970
The best time is after the attack...

926
02:17:57,060 --> 02:17:59,810
when there's a truce to get the wounded.

927
02:18:00,930 --> 02:18:02,640
If I could do it...

928
02:18:03,100 --> 02:18:05,520
I could save many thousands of men.

929
02:18:11,190 --> 02:18:13,360
But what I lack is the guts.

930
02:18:19,370 --> 02:18:22,500
They're beginning their daily slaughter
right on time.

931
02:18:22,580 --> 02:18:26,130
Captain all companies
are awaiting your orders.

932
02:18:26,210 --> 02:18:27,790
Be right there.

933
02:18:41,220 --> 02:18:42,560
Let's go.

934
02:18:43,600 --> 02:18:45,350
All right friends...

935
02:18:45,440 --> 02:18:47,980
come along and enjoy the spectacle.

936
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:21,720
Companies report!

937
02:19:21,810 --> 02:19:24,730
Company B ready!

938
02:19:24,810 --> 02:19:27,440
Company E ready!

939
02:19:27,520 --> 02:19:29,560
Company D ready!

940
02:19:35,400 --> 02:19:38,570
Companies forward!

941
02:20:01,220 --> 02:20:04,060
It looks like the captain is
really asking for a bullet in his guts.

942
02:20:04,140 --> 02:20:05,310
Yeah.

943
02:20:58,780 --> 02:21:01,700
I've never seen so many men
wasted so badly.

944
02:21:22,430 --> 02:21:26,050
I have a feeling it's really
gonna be a good long battle.

945
02:21:30,230 --> 02:21:32,480
- Blondie?
- Huh?

946
02:21:32,560 --> 02:21:36,480
The money's on the other side of the river.

947
02:21:36,570 --> 02:21:37,770
Where?

948
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:43,570
Amigo I said the other side
and that's enough.

949
02:21:44,450 --> 02:21:48,120
But while the Confederates are there
we can't get across.

950
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:52,830
What would happen if somebody were
to blow up that bridge?

951
02:21:54,540 --> 02:21:55,670
Yeah.

952
02:21:56,750 --> 02:22:00,050
Then these idiots would go
somewhere else to fight.

953
02:22:00,380 --> 02:22:01,590
Maybe.

954
02:22:39,630 --> 02:22:42,170
Doctor quick the captain's wounded.

955
02:22:44,930 --> 02:22:46,680
Hurry a stretcher.

956
02:22:49,100 --> 02:22:50,640
Easy. Easy now.

957
02:23:01,650 --> 02:23:03,320
Get things ready.

958
02:23:24,220 --> 02:23:26,340
A little of this will help.

959
02:23:32,680 --> 02:23:35,230
Take a slug of this Captain.

960
02:23:35,310 --> 02:23:37,100
Keep your ears open.

961
02:24:25,990 --> 02:24:28,610
What are you doing? No leave me alone.

962
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:12,720
You realize we might be risking our lives.

963
02:26:12,800 --> 02:26:15,050
Yeah and if I get killed...

964
02:26:15,140 --> 02:26:18,510
you'll never get your hands
on all that beautiful money.

965
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:20,100
Yeah Tuco...

966
02:26:21,350 --> 02:26:23,350
it sure would be a pity.

967
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:54,880
Doc.

968
02:26:57,010 --> 02:26:58,300
Doctor...

969
02:26:59,140 --> 02:27:01,930
could you help me live a little more?

970
02:27:02,020 --> 02:27:03,770
I expect good news.

971
02:27:54,780 --> 02:27:58,110
Why don't we tell each other
our half of the secret?

972
02:27:58,200 --> 02:28:02,280
- Why don't we?
- Huh? You go first.

973
02:28:05,330 --> 02:28:07,910
No I think it's better that...

974
02:28:10,290 --> 02:28:11,630
you start.

975
02:28:15,970 --> 02:28:17,300
All right.

976
02:28:19,680 --> 02:28:21,760
The name of the cemetery is...

977
02:28:39,950 --> 02:28:42,070
Sad Hill. Now it's your turn.

978
02:28:50,370 --> 02:28:52,920
The name on the grave is...

979
02:28:56,840 --> 02:28:58,340
Arch Stanton.

980
02:29:00,470 --> 02:29:03,300
Arch Stanton? Are you sure?

981
02:29:04,680 --> 02:29:06,470
Yeah sure I'm sure.

982
02:40:55,140 --> 02:40:57,480
It'll be a lot easier with that.

983
02:41:37,770 --> 02:41:40,640
Two can dig a lot quicker than one.

984
02:41:40,730 --> 02:41:41,810
Dig.

985
02:41:44,860 --> 02:41:46,610
You're not digging.

986
02:41:58,750 --> 02:42:02,040
If you shoot me
you won't see a cent of that money.

987
02:42:04,210 --> 02:42:05,290
Why?

988
02:42:08,300 --> 02:42:09,960
I'll tell you why.

989
02:42:11,090 --> 02:42:13,470
'Cause there's nothing in there.

990
02:42:21,520 --> 02:42:22,980
Why you son of a--

991
02:42:23,060 --> 02:42:25,150
You thought I'd trust you?

992
02:42:28,190 --> 02:42:30,360
$200000 is a lot of money.

993
02:42:32,200 --> 02:42:34,360
We're gonna have to earn it.

994
02:42:37,660 --> 02:42:38,740
How?

995
02:42:50,300 --> 02:42:52,840
I'll write the name
on the bottom of this stone.

996
02:42:56,970 --> 02:42:58,220
The gun.

997
02:49:04,880 --> 02:49:08,590
You pig. You want to get me killed?
When'd you unload it?

998
02:49:10,720 --> 02:49:12,140
Last night.

999
02:49:13,260 --> 02:49:17,980
You see in this world there's
two kinds of people my friend--

1000
02:49:18,060 --> 02:49:20,190
those with loaded guns...

1001
02:49:20,270 --> 02:49:22,650
and those who dig.

1002
02:49:22,730 --> 02:49:25,110
- You dig.
- Where?

1003
02:49:36,620 --> 02:49:37,740
Here.

1004
02:49:42,130 --> 02:49:44,000
There's no name on it!

1005
02:49:45,250 --> 02:49:47,420
There's no name here either.

1006
02:49:49,090 --> 02:49:51,930
You see that's what Bill Carson told me.

1007
02:49:52,010 --> 02:49:53,840
It was the grave marked "Unknown"...

1008
02:49:53,930 --> 02:49:55,970
right beside Arch Stanton.

1009
02:50:03,730 --> 02:50:05,310
Go ahead.

1010
02:51:03,160 --> 02:51:05,710
Blondie! It's all ours Blondie!

1011
02:51:22,640 --> 02:51:26,600
You're joking Blondie. You wouldn't
play a joke on me like that.

1012
02:51:27,980 --> 02:51:30,320
It's no joke. It's a rope Tuco.

1013
02:51:31,070 --> 02:51:35,070
Now I want you to stand up there
and put your head in that noose.

1014
02:52:41,720 --> 02:52:45,810
Well now seems just like old times.

1015
02:52:50,190 --> 02:52:52,110
Four for you...

1016
02:52:53,780 --> 02:52:55,360
and four--

1017
02:52:58,610 --> 02:53:00,030
four for me.

1018
02:53:38,820 --> 02:53:41,490
Hey Blondie.

1019
02:53:42,660 --> 02:53:44,120
Sorry Tuco.

1020
02:53:58,920 --> 02:55:20,250
Blondie!

1021
02:56:20,940 --> 02:56:22,480
Hey Blondie!

1022
02:56:24,530 --> 02:56:27,820
You know what you are?

1023
02:56:31,030 --> 02:56:33,100
Just a dirty son of a bitch!
